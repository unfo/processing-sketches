First steps into the world of game/gfx programming

> The best way to learn basics is just to take some simple 80's arcade games and recreate them. Think of pacman, frogger, donkey kong, asteroids and breakout. These games should be do-able in about a days worth of coding in any modern programming language/Game IDE such as XNA/Unity/Java/Flash. If you done that, you can move on to early NES early 90s DOS based games, which are a bit more complex (different gamestates, improved physics etc) or recreate boardgames like chess, checkers or any other game with turn based control and a more complex set of rules.
